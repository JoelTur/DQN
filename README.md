# Implementation of Deep Q-learning
DQN implementation to play several games. The algorithm is based on the article https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602. You need to have Scikit-Image, PLE, Pytorch, OpenAI Gym, and TS installed.

# Installion instructions:  
PLE = https://github.com/ntasfi/PyGame-Learning-Environment  
TS = https://www.tensorflow.org/install  
OpenAI gym = https://gym.openai.com/docs/#installation  
Pytorch = https://pytorch.org/  
Scikit-Image = https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/install.html  
# Running a program
After succesfull installation of the libraries you can run DQN_FLAPPY.py with a command   
```
python DQN_FLAPPY.py
```
and DQN_LUNAR_TORCH.py with a command
```
python DQN_LUNAR_TORCH.py
```
