# Implementation of Deep Q-learning
DQN implementation to play several games. The algorithm is based on the article https://deepmind.com/research/publications/2019/human-level-control-through-deep-reinforcement-learning. You need to have Scikit-Image, Pytorch and OpenAI Gym.

# Installion instructions:  

OpenAI gym = https://gym.openai.com/docs/#installation  
Pytorch = https://pytorch.org/  
Scikit-Image = https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/install.html  
# Running a program
After succesfull installation of the libraries you can run DQN_FLAPPY.py with a command   
```
python ATARI_SIMULATION.py
```

# Results

Breakout 171 on avarage.
